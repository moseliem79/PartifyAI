# PartifyAI: Auto Parts Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

This repository provides a complete pipeline for generating synthetic auto parts sales data, training a regression model with hyperparameter tuning, and performing production-grade inference.

## Main Components

- **Data Generation and Analysis (`data/collect_data.py`)**
  - Generates a synthetic dataset for auto parts sales, including product IDs, categories, brands, car models, prices, and monthly sales.
  - Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using matplotlib and seaborn.

- **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning (`models/train_model.py`)**
  - Trains an XGBoost regression model to predict sales metrics.
  - Uses Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization.
  - Saves the trained model and preprocessor as `.pkl` files.
  - Evaluates model performance using RMSE, MAE, and R².

- **Inference and Production Prediction (`inference/predict.py`)**
  - Loads the trained model and preprocessor.
  - Performs predictions on new data and outputs results.
  - Designed for integration in production environments.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Generate synthetic data:**
   ```
   python data/collect_data.py
   ```

3. **Train the model:**
   ```
   python models/train_model.py
   ```

4. **Run inference:**
   ```
   python inference/predict.py
   ```
